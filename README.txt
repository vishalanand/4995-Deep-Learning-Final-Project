Results:
----------------------------------------------------
We have achieved 77.56% accuracy on topic modeling infused bi-directional morpheme based LSTM architectures. Final report consists of details about the same.

----------------------------------------------------
Preparation:
----------------------------------------------------
Download and unzip the file. The models, script and data can be found as described in the tree structure below.

Download pre-trained glove vectors [Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download)] from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ 

Save the downloaded glove file inside data/ (Refer structure of the setup below)

----------------------------------------------------
Execution for best model:
----------------------------------------------------
We used pip freeze to get all the requirements. So, all the dependencies can be installed by running: pip install -r requirements.txt

Open preprocess-morphemes.ipynb and run it first: This will generate processed train and dev files with topics

Open answer-with_topics.ipynb and run them: This will train and save the model
